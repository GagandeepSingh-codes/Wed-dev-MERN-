    <p><b>Earth</b> is the <b>third planet</b> from the sun and is the <b>largest</b> of the <b>terrestrial planets</b>. This is enabled by Earth being an ocean world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere.

    Life has existed on Earth for at least 3.5 billion years, and the planet's biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere and other abiotic conditions. The earliest evidence of life on Earth is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48-billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia. Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties, and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive. As far as is known, Earth is the only place in the universe where life occurs naturally.
